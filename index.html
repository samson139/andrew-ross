          "Lots of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of
          daytime soap opera version showing the personalitoes of the players
          rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened.
          Even that would not have been so bad but the movie tries to potray
          lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right
          thing."

          "I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how this
          large group of capitalist pigs could royally screw their families,
          descendants, neighbors,countrymen and the rest of the whole world with
          absolutely no compassion."
